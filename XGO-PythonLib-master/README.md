# XGO-PythonLib

XGO2 has built-in motion libraries for controlling the movement and various features of the machine dog, including battery level, firmware version, and servo angle. The motion library enables users to control translation and pose movement, as well as single servo and single-leg movement. The education library facilitates camera, screen, key, microphone, and speaker operations, as well as commonly used AI functions such as gesture recognition, face detection, emotional recognition, and age and gender recognition.  The detailed instructions for use of the library are as follows.

PythonLib included xgolib.py and xgoedu.py
